Description about files in the reprository

1. Predicted the house prices using only Numerical And Categorical Data by the help of MultiLayer Perceptron. Code for this is present in mlp_regression.py file.

2. Predicted the house prices using image of the inside features of the house such as bathroom, bedroom, etc. by the help of Convolutional Neural Networks. Code for this is present in cnn_regression.py file.

3. Predicted the house prices using both Numerical, Categorical Data and using images of inside features of the house by the help of both CNN and MLP. Code for this is present in mixed_training.py file.
